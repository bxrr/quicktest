			Quote: 
			This was a demoniac laugh—low, suppressed, and deep—
			uttered, as it seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber
			door. The head of my bed was near the door, and I thought
			at first the goblin-laugher stood at my bedside—or rather,
			crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and could
			see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was
			reiterated (225).</p>
